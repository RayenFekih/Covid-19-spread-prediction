# Covid-19-spread-prediction
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified COVID-19 as a
pandemic. At the time, the number of confirmed cases were over 130,000 across 114 countries
around the world, with the number of deaths caused by the disease over 5,000. The objective of
this project is to build an epidemiological model that predicts the spread of COVID-19 throughout
the world. The target variable is the cumulative number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in each
country by each date.

#Data
The train data contains data from 22 January to 5 March 2020. “Target” is the number of confirmed
deaths and “Cases” is the number of reported infections.
